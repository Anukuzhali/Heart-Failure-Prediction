# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.

Early detection, and managment of cardiovascular diseases can be a great way to manage the fatality rate associated with cardiovascular diseases, and this is where a machine learning model comes in.

For the purpose of predicting the risk of a heart failure in patients, We have used Decision Tree classifier as our final model in which we got a better accuracy.

We have extensively visualized each variables and get info from them 

We have removed outliers which helped to improve accuracy

we have selected important features using Extra Trees Regressor and used time, ejection_fraction,age,serum_creatinine features to build our final model

We have used Flask framework to create web app
